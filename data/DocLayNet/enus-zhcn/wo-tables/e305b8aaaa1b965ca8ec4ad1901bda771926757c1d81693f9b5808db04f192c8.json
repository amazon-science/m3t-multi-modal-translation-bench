To fund the Mandalay acquisition, we entered into the revised bank credit facility, which will provide the required funds to fund payments to Mandalay's shareholders and holders of Mandalay's convertible debentures, as well as refinance certain of Mandalay's outstanding borrowings. We are required to sell our interest in one of the two casinos in Detroit, Michigan. The sale of either of these interests will generate significant cash flow. We have generated over $740 million in operating cash flow in each of the past three which included deductions for interest payments, tax payments and certain contractually committed payments reflected in the above table, including operating leases, employment agreements and entertainment agreements. We expect to generate a higher level of operating cash flow in 2005 due to improved operating results, expanded facilities and the Mandalay acquisition.",
