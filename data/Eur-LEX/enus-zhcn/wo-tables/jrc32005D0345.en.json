Only one real reason for these difficulties was put forward, namely ineffective group and management structures, including the lack of an effective system of risk control. There was no in-depth analysis of these structures or of specific management shortcomings, such as the implications of state ownership. However, the Commission took the view that an analysis of this kind was necessary if there was to be a proper assessment of the prospects for the restructured BGB. It doubted therefore whether the causes of BGB's difficulties were properly identified and addressed in the restructuring plan.
